The fact that people develop such powerful software and give it to the public as open source still honestly astonishes me after years of passion about open-source-software. Social considerations aside, I recently stumbled upon an interesting feature that was not covered in the tutorials I came across, because, let\u0026rsquo;s be honest, open-source is great, but bright people definitely spend more time writing software then explaining others what they created and why.","tags":null,"title":"Recursivity and permutations","url":"https://MechEngrLorenzoFiore.github.io/posts/recursivity_and_permutations/"},{"categories":["Resources"],"description":"Inverse Analysis in FEniCS Motivation and context  The FEniCS open-source computing platform is a wonderful collection of software, it contains all the tools needed to rigorously define a mathematical problem in computer code in a very high level form, it feels almost as writing the equations of physics and let the computer solve them for you! Well\u0026hellip; to be honest FEniCS only provides the backbone of a full fledged Finite Element Software, it\u0026rsquo;s like having a kit to be assembled according to ones taste: everything that goes from the definition of the equations of physics, to the handling of incremental solving procedure and output is a user-responsibility.","tags":null,"title":"Inverse Analysis in FEniCS","url":"https://MechEngrLorenzoFiore.github.io/posts/inverse_analysis_in_fenics/"},{"categories":["Resources"],"description":"Going Variational Motivation and context How to solve PDEs with modern tools\nChallenges I faced  There are tons of good resources about the FEM, its theory and practical applications and the material is indeed overwhelming. Here some books that built my path towards a medium understanding of what I\u0026rsquo;m doing:  Zienkiewicz and Taylor 2006 - The Finite Element Method for Solid and Structural Mechanics.

This collection of software allows the user to define whatever Partial Differential Equation on a geometrical domain and automate all the process from the definition of finite elements to solution of the equation, it\u0026rsquo;s simply brilliant!
